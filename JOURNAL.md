## 11/6/2025 7 PM - Started the Schmatic  

I begun the schematic. A pico and RTC will be the heart of this, gpio pins will contorl transistors to allow the correct leds to light up. An rtc module will contorl the time. I've still to connect the leds and transistors. I will soon start to have too think about the actual components to allow right current and voltage ect. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODczOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--93916cabbd9fed9ee5eda8e05623732facfa5ba1/image.png) ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODczOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--66dc95b330d3e6c3ad2b2221f03f658c0e9dc00c/image.png)  

## 11/6/2025 9 PM - All thats left to do is resistors  

Finished connecting all the LEDs and transistors, Yet to add the restiance for the resistors from the power and yet to pun any restiors on the gpio lines. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODk3OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4f810490c3784600089a1dae3319d7b731d27146/image.png)
  

## 11/7/2025 - Finished the Schematic  

Finished the Schematic. All the components and wires in place. All the resitors now have values. And picked out all my componets from Mouser, still need to do the BOM but I've got them all so that should be easy. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTIwNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--85231a8b8cc7b39665e2e73addbebcb4b458e53a/image.png)
  

## 11/8/2025 11 AM - V1 of BOM complete  

Got all the parts selected and made a [BOM](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTM2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e1ad649c08b2cf2d86da2a36774f975a52a059b6/BOM.csv). Almost all componets are from Mouser with the only non Mouser part being the RTC Breakout board (from Amazon). ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTM2MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fb60c7147071e88a8cec33c89c2f2ad7adc1e2bf/image.png)
  

## 11/8/2025 7 PM - 75% through the PCB  

Almost done desgining, got down the layout, started the routing process. The PCB will be roughly 24cm x 8 cm in size. IDK why it took soo long to get here. I think I might print a stand for it! ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTUzNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1d9a522957208ca79d5bd97b3559d3c705edf55d/image.png)
  

## 11/9/2025 4 PM - Finished desgining the PCB  

Finnished the pcb, all parts routed, all parts placed. This took way longer than I thought it would as usall, you never really think about it till you start logging it. Just now to get all the requirements and then finnally ship it! ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTc4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8760ed459ecb73188ae9fff5a77c78dc8e30afa3/image.png)
  

## 11/9/2025 6 PM - Stand - Time Spent 25 Min  

After thinking some thoughts I quickly made up a litte stand for the pcb. I will probally end up making somthing similar out of bent acylic, this mostly just a quick visaulisation. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTgyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--750348525759315b7b2e5d4c14da768495b51704/image.png) ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTgyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c4f3a0bd6e778b50814eddde306838deef97be51/image.png)
